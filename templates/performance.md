## 🚀 Optimization Target
<!--
  What specifically are we optimizing?
  - Page load time?
  - Database query latency?
  - Memory usage?
-->

## 📊 Benchmarks
<!--
  You MUST include Before/After metrics.
  
  | Metric | Before | After | Change |
  |--------|--------|-------|--------|
  | p95 Latency | 500ms | 120ms | -76% |
  | Bundle Size | 2.5MB | 2.1MB | -16% |
-->

## 🛠 Strategy
<!--
  How was this achieved?
  - Algorithm change?
  - Caching?
  - Lazy loading?
-->

## ⚠️ Risks
<!--
  Does this optimization introduce complexity or potential race conditions?
