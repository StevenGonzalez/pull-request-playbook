# Refactor Pull Request Template

## Purpose
<!--
  Why are we refactoring this?
  - Performance improvement?
  - Code readability?
  - Prepping for a future feature?
-->

## Changes
<!--
  What exactly was moved/renamed/changed?
  Did you introduce new patterns?
-->

## Risk Assessment
<!--
  Refactors should ideally not change behavior.
  Is there any risk of breaking existing functionality?
  What specific areas should be regression tested?
-->

## Verification
<!--
  How did you verify that behavior remains unchanged?
  - [ ] Existing tests passed
  - [ ] Manual smoke test
-->
