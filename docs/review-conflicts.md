# Handling Conflicts

Disagreements in code review are normal. Here's how to handle them professionally.

## 1. Assume Positive Intent
The reviewer isn't attacking you; they are trying to improve the codebase. The author isn't being lazy; they might have context you lack.

## 2. Pick Your Battles
Reviewers: Is this blocking deployment? Is it a hill worth dying on?
Authors: Is the suggested change actually worse, or just different?

## 3. Move to Synchronous Communication
If you have gone back and forth more than 3 times in comments:
**Stop typing.**
Hop on a Zoom/Slack huddle/Teams call. 5 minutes of talking resolves what 2 days of typing cannot.

## 4. Default to the Author
If the choice is subjective (e.g., naming preference) and there is no strict style guide:
**Let the author decide.** They did the work.

## 5. Bring in a Tie-Breaker
If you are deadlocked on an architectural decision, tag a senior engineer or team lead for a third opinion. "We're stuck on X vs Y, could you weigh in?"
