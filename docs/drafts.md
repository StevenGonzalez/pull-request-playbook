# Draft PRs

Draft Pull Requests (or Work In Progress - WIP) are a powerful tool for collaboration *before* the code is finished.

## When to use Drafts

### 1. Proof of Concept / RFC
"I'm thinking of implementing the feature this way. What do you think before I write 500 lines of code?"
- **Goal**: Architecture validation.

### 2. CI Feedback
You want to see if your code passes tests/linting on the CI server without notifying the whole team.

### 3. "Saving" Work
Pushing work to the server to back it up or move to another machine.

## Etiquette

- **Don't assign reviewers** until it's ready (unless you specifically want early feedback).
- **Mark it clearly**: Use the GitHub "Convert to Draft" button.
- **Don't leave it open forever**: See [Anti-Patterns - WIP Forever](anti-patterns.md).
