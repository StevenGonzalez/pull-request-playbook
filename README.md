## 🎭 Philosophy

Great pull requests are not just about code - they're about **communication**, **respect for reviewers' time**, and **enabling better software**. The best PRs share these characteristics:

### 1. **Clear Intent**
Every PR should answer: *Why does this change exist?* Great PRs tell a story that connects business value to technical implementation.

### 2. **Right-Sized**
The ideal PR can be reviewed in 20-30 minutes. If it takes longer, it's probably too big. Small PRs get better reviews, ship faster, and have fewer bugs.

### 3. **Self-Documenting**
A reviewer shouldn't need to ask "what" or "why." The PR title, description, code comments, and commit messages should create a complete narrative.

### 4. **Respect for Time**
Code review is one of the most valuable activities in software development. Great PRs make the reviewer's job easier through clarity, context, and completeness.

### 5. **Review-Ready**
Before requesting review: tests pass, linting is clean, conflicts are resolved, and you've self-reviewed your own changes.

## 🔬 The Anatomy of a Great PR

A great pull request has six essential components:

### 1. **The Title** 📌
- Clear, specific, and scannable
- Follows a consistent format (e.g., `[Type] Brief description`)
- Examples:
  - ✅ `[Feature] Add user authentication with OAuth2`
  - ✅ `[Bug] Fix memory leak in WebSocket connection handler`
  - ❌ `Update stuff` (too vague)
  - ❌ `Fix issue #1234` (not self-documenting)

### 2. **The Description** 📝
The most critical part. Should include:
- **What**: What changed?
- **Why**: Why was this change necessary?
- **How**: How was it implemented? (for complex changes)
- **Testing**: How was it tested?
- **Screenshots/Videos**: For UI changes
- **Breaking Changes**: Any backwards incompatibilities?
- **Related Issues**: Links to tickets, discussions, or docs

### 3. **The Commits** 💾
- Atomic and logical (each commit = one logical change)
- Clear commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Easy to bisect if things go wrong

### 4. **The Diff** 🔍
- Focused on one concern
- No unrelated formatting changes
- No commented-out code or debug logs
- Readable and scannable

### 5. **The Tests** ✅
- New features include tests
- Bug fixes include regression tests
- All tests passing in CI
- Coverage metrics maintained or improved

### 6. **The Context** 🌐
- Links to related PRs, issues, or documentation
- Screenshots or recordings for visual changes
- Performance benchmarks for optimization work
- Migration guide for breaking changes

📚 **Deep Dive**: Read the complete [Anatomy Guide](docs/anatomy.md) for detailed explanations and examples.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes and how to fix them:

### The "God PR" 
❌ **Problem**: 3,000 lines changed across 47 files  
✅ **Solution**: Break into smaller, focused PRs

### The "Mystery PR"
❌ **Problem**: No description, title is "fix stuff"  
✅ **Solution**: Write clear title and comprehensive description

### The "Kitchen Sink"
❌ **Problem**: Includes refactoring, new feature, and bug fixes  
✅ **Solution**: One concern per PR

### The "WIP Forever"
❌ **Problem**: Marked as draft for weeks with no updates  
✅ **Solution**: Either finish it or close it

📚 **Full List**: See [complete anti-patterns guide](docs/anti-patterns.md) with examples and fixes.

## 👀 For Reviewers

Great reviews are just as important as great PRs:

- [**Reviewer's Guide**](docs/reviewers-guide.md) - How to give effective, constructive feedback
- [**Review Checklist**](docs/review-checklist.md) - What to look for when reviewing
- [**Comment Templates**](docs/review-comments.md) - Effective ways to phrase feedback
- [**Handling Conflicts**](docs/review-conflicts.md) - Resolving disagreements gracefully

**Key Principle**: Review the code, not the person. Be kind, be specific, be helpful.
